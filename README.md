Features
------------------

This application allows for sorting by the various headers at the top of the page. This sort goes by ascending and descending order when clicked on a second time. The serach bar allows an additional function of filtering out the results so that only the results that match the searched letters will appear.


Lessons learned
---------------------
Dealing with React still leads me to complications. I was unsure about how exactly to incorporate both search and sort into this application. 

I referenced the sort function under javascript and looked up some examples from the internet. In my endavors to incorporate the same kind of sort in my code, I noticed there was no functionality. This is due to me not understanding what exactly needs to be passed into the sort parameters due to the information required having to be called via react components. 

The search function I had help from a cohort member with. The example search given did function however I had difficulties trying to understand and incorporate the same kind of search feature within my own application. This I may be able to experiment and study with inorder to achieve this understanding. 

This application will not display from the deployed site despite following the same steps as a similiar project that deployed successfully. Unsure why this happened.
